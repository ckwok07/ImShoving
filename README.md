## Step 1:
how do I even represent the cards? a standard deck has 52 cards, 13 ranks, 4 suits each.

Thus 2 classes of all the ranks (2-14) and all the suits (0-3) were created. 
Then a card class, with fields rank and suit to represent a card.
To create an actual deck, a deck class with a field of all possible cards was made. To simulate the shuffling, random was used and to draw, pop() was used. this allows the user to draw a two cards to generate a hand.
